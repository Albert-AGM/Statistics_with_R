title: "Statistics with R"

---

On this site there are some exercise performed during the completion of the course Statistics with R by University of Duke.

On the assignment, you will need to imagine that you are a statistical consultant who has recently been hired by a real estate investment firm based in Ames, Iowa. They have had an intern collect and collate all of the recent house sales in Ames and have put together a large spreadsheet that contains the sale price of each house along with many of its physical features. Your employers want you to take this data and develop a model to predict the selling price of a given home. They hope to use this information to help assess whether the asking price of a house is higher or lower than the true value of the house. If the home is undervalued, it may be a good investment for the firm.
